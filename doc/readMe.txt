Design Objective:

We need a very Agile Quad that is able to serve alcohol drinks to its human overloard.
When the quad sees the bottle empty. It goes ahead and fill the bottle

Benchmark: 

1. Sensor/Power/ESC_board could be stacked together and ready for to be integrated

2. A safe quad that is able to fly (and then crash), no vibration and other linearities, sensor data
could be received

3. An agile quadcopter that is able to hover, change pitch and position 
RC remote control established

4. Vision and AI program work as expected 

5. Ready for the show: 

Alcohol serving , ping pong , cameras or other stuff 
Friendly and smart robot

FAQs:

Role of the ultrasonic rangefinder: local altitude sensing and control(as opposed to having a GPS)
